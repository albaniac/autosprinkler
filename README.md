# autosprinkler
Auto water sprinkler project for my back yard

## Prerequisites
- Raspberry pi
- Arduino
- Hose pipes
- T-pipe(optional)
- Solenoid valve(normally open)
- Raspberry pi 433mhz transmitter
- Arduino 433mhz reciever
- Connector pipes
- Tap valve
- Hose connector
- Relay

## To build
### Software
Download sprinklercontroller.ino and ???.py and upload respectively to Arduino and Raspberry pi. After installing these you should be ready to go.

### Hardware
Install the Solenoid valve and T-pipe to water source (T-pipe only required if you still want to use original tap). Then connect hose adapter and hose pipe before creating a sprinkler system aroudn the needed parts of the garden. Connect switch to Solenoid valve and power supply.
Now the sprinkler system should be working, test by switching the switch on.
